Wallpaper Manager
==============

A dirt-simple GTK+ app to set the wallpaper on your desktop if you are not using a desktop manager.

Requires hsetroot for setting the wallpaper, and ImageMagick for resizing/cropping images.

- Also provides a simple interface to start/stop/configure my wallpaper shuffler called "rnd-bg"
- If you want to use this you must edit the constants at the top of each file
- The resolution can be changed by calling rnd-bg with the option **-res WIDTHxHEIGHT**, but if you set the constant in the script then no option is required for your custom resolution
- I could make it so you don't have to edit constants but I doubt anyone will ever use this
